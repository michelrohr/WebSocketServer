# WebSocketServer
WebSocket server class implemented in PHP. (inspired by nVentis)

# How to use
The main file WebSocketServer.php has to be included in your PHP file. After that, create a custom class which extends to WebSocketServer. For a test implementation, see exampleServer.php. Make sure to run the script in the PHP command-line interface. An example on Windows with XAMPP could be
* D:\XAMPP\php\php.exe -f "D:\XAMPP\htdocs\PHP-WebSocketServer\example.php" .
